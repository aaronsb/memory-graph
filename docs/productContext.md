# Product Context

## Purpose
This project aims to create an MCP server that enables persistent memory capabilities for Claude through a local knowledge graph implementation. It is based on the reference implementation at https://github.com/shaneholloman/mcp-knowledge-graph.

## Problems Solved
- Enables Claude to maintain context and information across chat sessions
- Provides a structured way to store and retrieve knowledge using a graph database
- Allows for customizable memory storage paths
- Improves upon the original Memory Server implementation with local knowledge graph capabilities

## Intended Functionality
- Store information from chat sessions in a local knowledge graph
- Allow Claude to query and retrieve previously stored information
- Support customizable memory paths for flexible data organization
- Maintain persistence across different chat sessions
- Provide tools for storing and retrieving memory nodes
